<Update label="March 2025">

## New API Endpoints

We've expanded our API with three powerful new endpoints to enhance your document workflow:

- **`/format`**: Transform documents into clean, structured text and markdown formats. Additional formats including tables and chunks are coming soon.
- **`/schema`**: Generate extraction schemas automatically by simply providing a file URL – no need to build schemas from scratch.
- **`/upload`**: Upload your documents and receive a signed URL for immediate use with our API.

For full details, visit the [API Reference](/api-reference).
