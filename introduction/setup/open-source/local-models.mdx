## Enable Local Models

To enable the use of local LLM models, set the `BASE_URL` in your `.env` file:

```bash example
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
```

### Available Models
You can find the list of models available to use [here](installation#set-up-environment-variables).

By default, the Llava model will be used. However, you can specify a different model in your code:

```javascript
import { extract } from 'documind';

const result = await extract({
  file: 'https://example.com/document.pdf',
  model: 'llama3.2-vision' 
});

console.log(result);
```
<Warning> Local models may not always provide optimal results. We are continually working to improve performance and add support for newer models. </Warning>
